Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence has long been viewed as a complex system with many parts. This has made it hard to develop a comprehensive theory of AI. One approach has been to focus on a single cognitive system, such as the human brain, and to reduce AI to a computational theory. This approach has several advantages. First, computationalism is consistent. It is possible to rule out AI without appealing to supernatural powers or philosophical frameworks. Second, computationalism reduces the cognitive load by specifying a unchanging model.
