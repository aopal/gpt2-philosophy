# gpt2-philosophy

A simple python server and webpage for interacting with pre-trained GPT-2 models.

Based heavily on the original GPT-2 source code (https://github.com/openai/gpt-2), Neil Shepperd's fork of it (https://github.com/nshepperd/gpt-2) and Max Woolf's gpt-2-simple (https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple).

## future

Fine-tune the 375M version of gpt-2 on various philosophy papers on artifical intelligence, and use that model for the server. Training will be done via the colaboratory notebook linked in Max Woolf's blog post [here](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/).
